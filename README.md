Code Fun Do++ 2018
We plan to develop an android mobile application which would help during and after natural disasters like flood,earthquake,etc.The GUI interface would consist of a login page in which the user can login using his mobile number.The home page would consist of all the emergency contacts of the rescue team(government provided) and the volunteers involved in the process along with the normal helpline numbers like that of medical or police emergency.Now there would be two kinds of people ,one who have been safely rescued and trying to assist the team in helping other relatives ,and the other who are still in need of help.The location can be tracked using GPS, which needs to be turned ON all the time.
The Rescue Team can be contacted using messages and over call.On receiving a signal ,team would record his location and group the requests according to priority.The priority can be decided on the basis of requests coming from a particular geographical region.This region can be defined basis on the spread of the disaster.The team would respond back with a notification so that the person can feel a bit comfortable.The other thing is that ,when a person raises a request ,the request would be sent to a control center(set up specifically for this relief mission) and all the people in the contact list.The application would also have an option of fundraising in which people can donate money directly to the government nearest in hierarchy to the people(State Government instead of Central Government) and Non-Government Organizations(NGO's).The people in areas prone to natural disaster have to be educated how to use this application beforehand through awareness programs.
The requests would be received at a common Control Center and the they would decide which team to allot to different rescue places.This feature would also prove to be helpful to the volunteers as they must not be given requests to save people from far off areas.To optimize the process ,we can use algorithms like Nearest Neighbour which would help the rescue team to efficiently save lives in less time.
To improve it furthur ,we can incorporate the emergency numbers in the emergency contact list of the phone directory.This would help the people who are in great risk and short of time to open the application.
To conclude, the main aim is to provide the people a means to approach the government or volunteers for help easily instead of panicking and getting confused.The application would the government to communicate directly with the people in need of help and vice versa.
